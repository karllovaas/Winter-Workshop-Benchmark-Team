Growth is determined by sales to share (5 yrs) and I/B/E/S forecast (2 yrs)

Stocks are ranked by above metrics and rankings are converted to standardized units

Standardized units are then combined into a composite score (CVS) and then ranked by CVS.  A (non-linear?) probability algo is applied to the CVS to assign growth and value weights to each stock. Low CVS is given to growth, high is given to value, and range given to both categories?

A stock that is given 20% weight in the value index would have an 80% weight in the growth index (before application of index weight capping)

Indexes with "Benchmark" in the name are the uncapped versions of the style indexes. Prior to March 24, 2025, the index history for the growth or value “Benchmark” index is identical to that of its respective standard
Russell US Style Index.
